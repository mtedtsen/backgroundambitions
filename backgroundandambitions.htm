<h1>Background and Ambitions</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>

<p> My name is Merridith Tedtsen. I was born on May 25, 1995 in Minneola, New York. I have no idea what time I was born at, primarily because my mom doesn't remember. I am not including this as a dig at my dear old ma, but instead as a witty lead in to one of the more interesting facts about myself. My mom doesn't remember what time I was born at because she has too many kids to remember. I am the oldest of five girls. Intersting fact #2, my mom is also the oldest of five girls and so is her mom. That makes me the first of the first of the first, or at least that is what my grandma tells me. (I'm kind of her favorite...but don't tell my sisters.)</p>

<p>I was born in New York, but I have also lived in Connecticut and I spent the majority of my childhood in Chesapeake Beach, Maryland. No matter where I have lived, I have always been close to my "extended" family. My grandparents live right across the street from my house in Maryland and all of my aunts (my moms younger sisters) live within a ten mile radius. Family get-togethers are a weekly occurence and all of my summer memories are of back yard BBQ's and family camping trips. Long story short, my family is the most important thing in the world to me and I love spending time with those crazies. </p>

<h2>Ambitions</h2>

<p>Academically, I have always been driven. I don't consider myself to be an overly intelligent person, but instead think that I work really hard to make sure I understand what it is that I am supposed to be learning. I have always preferred math and science to reading and language arts. I think this is because, in my opinion, the concept of subjectivity plays too large a roll in the "arts."</p>

<p>Because I enjoy science, my extracurricular activities have always had more of a quantitative theme about them. I have been on the math team, chess team, robotics and every other nerdy thing you can thing of. For a long time I thought that I wanted to be a surgeon, but thanks to an unfortunate accident with a sliding compound miter saw, I realized that I am not that fond of seeing blood, bones, or muscles unless they are in a diagram in a biology text book. I knew that no matter what field I went into, I wanted to help people with my profession, but for a while I didn't know how. Eventually engineering smacked me in the head as a good way to achieve that goal. </p>

<p>Deciding to major in engineering is really what led me to IIT, that and the fact that the application was free on the CommonApp. Once I was accepted I decided to attend because of the location, the money, and the engineering ranking. Presently, my favorite thing about IIT is the people. I truly believe that only a certain type of person comes here, and that type is AWESOME. eing on the women's soccer team has really helped to back up the statement I made about always being close to my extended family. I haven't really decided if I want to try and get a coterminal degree in mechanical engineering or not, but I do know that when I leave IIT I want to work with prosthetics. </p>
